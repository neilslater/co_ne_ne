CoNeNe TODOs:

    training data auto-shuffle

    Training data Marshal

    Bulk training

    Bulk error calculations

    Test that learning rate and momentum have an effect on training

    ---- Start from here in 2014 ??? ---

    Use SIMD for weight updates

    Holdout sets for generalisation

    Layer.clear_input (?)


CoNeNe DONE:

    Lock first layer in network, to prevent adding earlier layers

    Factor training cycle et al to struct_mlp_network

    Clone a network

    Fill starting NArrays with 0.0

    Init network from first layer

    Init network from array of layers (in Ruby)

    Marshalling, for layers and network

    Learning rate and momentum for network

    YARD docs

    Don't return ms_error on normal training

    Add training data class

    Fisher-Yates shuffle

    srand accept arrays
