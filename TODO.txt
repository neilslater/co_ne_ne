RuNeNe TODOs:

    Combine cost de_da with da_dz to go direct to de_dz for most/all output deltas . . .
        Combos for de_dz
        *  linear & mse
        *  sigmoid & logloss
        *  softmax & mlogloss
        *  relu & mse

        Non-optimised combos:
        *  sigmoid & mlogloss?
        *  tanh & logloss?

        *  sigmoid & mse?
        *  tanh & mse?

    RuNeNe::Trainer::BPLayer

    Completely re-architect layer/network
      layer_ff consists solely of num_inputs, num_outputs, weights, transfer function * DONE
      trainer adds data structures for tracking weight deltas etc
      network adds architecture (initially just a stack of layers)

    RuNeNe::Trainer::BPNetwork

    Perform batch feed-forward runs

    Perform batch backprop runs

    Re-do backprop into separate dE_da, dE_dz and dE_dW stages

    Gradient-checking tests

    Tests using MNIST digits

    mini-batch training

    Softmax layer


----- v0.0.1 release ?

    Optionally take writable output array (for performance)

    improved vectorisation

    Bulk predictions

    Training set normalisation

    Training set split (into CV, Test etc)

    dropout

    max norm regularisation

    l2 regularisation?

    rmsprop

    dynamic learning rate?

    auto-categorisation and category expansion

    training data auto-shuffle

    Residual gradients for RELU (& others?)

    Use SIMD for weight updates

    Holdout sets for generalisation

    Layer.clear_input (?)

    auto-encoders

    Import other NN trained models (cxxnet, caffe)
